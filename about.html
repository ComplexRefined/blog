<h3>Me, Dylan</h3>
<p>
  I am a Software Engineer who grew up in Durban, South Africa. I have always
  wanted to run a blog however I have always had excuses on how I don't have time
  or I am focused on something else. <img class="profilepic" src="/img/image.jpeg" alt="">
  The truth is, I will always be busy and
  focused on a number of things. I have also come to the realisation
  I don't know everything (surprise !!) and I have so much to learn.
</p>
<p>
  I am a strong believer in the fact that when trying to teach or explain a
  problem one can often solve the problem. Therefore I am running this blog as
  a sounding board on some of the perceptions I have particularly in the
  area of software development and business.
</p>

  Allow space for dreams and growth, don't rush.
</blockquote>
<p>
  I am the type of person who enjoys allowing
  space for dreams and growth. I strive to not be in a rush with anything that
  I do. Moreover consistency, quality and perseverance are qualities I hold on
  to. I place importance on communicating clearly, contributing constructively
  and meeting the expectations of the esteemed companies and people I come into
  contact with.

<h3>ComplexRefined, a Business</h3>
<p>
  Through over 10 years of development and a lot of lines of code in many businesses, I have come to start my own company.
  I have worked for both small and large organisations in 3 countries and have seen firsthand the vast differences between what a
  company or person needs versus what they want.
</p>

<p>Often times this is a process that grows for both myself and the person or company. What I aim to do under the banner of ComplexRefined the company,
  is ease this process and become a part of any team I am working with to create solutions that are meaningful and useful for the problems at hand.
</p>

<h4>Team</h4>
<p>I often operate as a contractor or consultant on a project, helping other teams get over the finish line. However through my network of contacts
  in the software development world I am able to gather a team around a problem that needs solving.
</p>

<p>Most importantly I love taking the time to understand a process or project that needs work on. In line with this, I would love to speak with you should you need my expertise.
  No problem is too small (or silly) to solve with software. If you need help navigating the online arena and what that means for your business, lets talk.

<h3>This blog</h3>
<p>
  This blog is designed to be a work in progress. An area where I intend on posting regularly about things I am dealing with on
  a day to day basis. This may take the form of neat solutions to coding problems, discussions on software architecture and also
  ideas and thoughts on running and owning a tech startup.
</p>

<p>
  As this is a work in progress, the site will change and evolve with myself and what I and my team are working on and interested in.
  We are not experts on every subject and certainly I am not. Therefore I encourage everyone to contact me and give constructive feedback
  where it is helpful.
</p>

<p>
  This is a public conversation, I look forward to hearing from you! <a href="/contact">Tell me your thoughts</a>
